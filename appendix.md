## My Revisions and Notes

**What I used from the LLM draft:**
- I used the overall structure and organization
- I used ideas for how to write bullet points professionally

**What I changed:**
- I changed all the facts to match my actual resume
- I wrote my own "About Me" section about my Red Cross journey
- I added my specific job details that the AI didn't know
- I included my volunteer work at Burnaby Hospice
- I added my contact information

**Why I made these changes:**

The LLM gave me a good starting point and helped me know what to include. But it didn't know my actual experiences, so I personalized everything to make sure my portfolio shows the real me.
